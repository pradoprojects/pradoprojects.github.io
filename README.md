# 👋 Hi, I’m Marllos  
### Early-career UX & Product Designer  
Focused on clarity, inclusivity, and thoughtful problem-solving.

I’m building a design career shaped by hands-on learning, multicultural experiences, teaching, and caregiving.  
I’m drawn to roles with mentorship, collaboration, and real product work — environments where curiosity and thoughtful execution matter.

I care about creating interfaces that feel intuitive, calm, and accessible — especially for people who don’t consider themselves “techy.”

## 🧠 How I Think

### **Simplifying complexity**  
Teaching basic programming to teenagers helped me break abstract concepts into clear, approachable steps — a skill that directly shapes how I structure interfaces and information.

### **Designing with empathy**  
Working with people of different ages and cognitive/physical needs strengthened my observation, patience, and adaptability.  
These experiences guide how I identify friction and design for comfort, not just functionality.

### **Human-first, tech-aware**  
My computer science background helps me understand how things work under the hood —  
but the decisions I make as a designer always begin with people, not features.
