# 👋 Hi, I’m Marllos  
### Early-career UX & Product Designer  
Focused on clarity, inclusivity, and thoughtful problem-solving.

I’m building a design career shaped by hands-on learning, multicultural experiences, teaching, and caregiving.  
I’m drawn to roles with mentorship, collaboration, and real product work — environments where curiosity is valued.

I care about creating interfaces that feel intuitive, calm, and accessible — especially for people who don’t consider themselves “techy.”

## 🧠 How I Think

### **Simplifying complexity**  
Teaching basic programming to teenagers taught me how to break abstract concepts into simple, approachable steps.

### **Designing with empathy**  
Working with people across different ages and cognitive/physical needs strengthened my observation skills, patience, and adaptability.

### **Human-first, tech-aware**  
My computer science background helps me understand how things work under the hood —  
but my design decisions are grounded in people, not features.
