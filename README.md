# Hi, I’m Marllos 👋
**Early-career UX & Product Designer focused on clarity, inclusivity, and thoughtful problem-solving.**

I’m building a design foundation shaped by teaching, multicultural experiences, and hands-on practice.  
I’m especially interested in apprenticeship and entry-level roles with mentorship, real product work, and space to grow.

---

## 🌟 What I care about
- Clear, low-friction interfaces  
- Accessibility built into the process  
- Simple, culturally aware design choices  
- Thoughtful collaboration and iteration  

---

## 🔎 How I think
- Teaching programming to teenagers taught me how to simplify complex ideas.  
- Working with people with diverse needs strengthened my empathy and adaptability.  
- My tech background helps me understand how things work, but I design with a human-first mindset.
