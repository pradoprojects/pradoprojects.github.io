# Hi, I’m Marllos  
### Early-career UX & Product Designer  
Focused on clarity, accessibility, and thoughtful problem-solving.

I’m building a design career shaped by hands-on learning, multicultural experiences, teaching, and caregiving.  
I’m especially drawn to roles with mentorship, collaboration, and real product impact — environments where curiosity and intention matter.

I care about creating interfaces that feel intuitive, calm, and accessible, especially for people who don’t see themselves as “techy.”

## How I Think

### **Simplifying complexity**  
Teaching programming to teenagers taught me how to turn abstract concepts into clear, approachable steps — a skill that directly shapes how I structure interfaces and information.

### **Designing with empathy**  
Working with people of different ages and cognitive/physical needs strengthened my observation skills, patience, and ability to adapt.  
These experiences help me identify friction and design for comfort, not just functionality.

### **Human-first, tech-aware**  
My computer science background helps me understand constraints and feasibility,  
but my design decisions always begin with people, not features.
