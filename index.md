        <h1>Hi, I’m Marllos 👋</h1>
        <h3>Early-career UX & Product Designer | Focused on clarity and thoughtful problem-solving.</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <h4>
                I’m building a career shaped by <em>continuous learning</em>, <em>multicultural experiences</em>,
                and a commitment to keeping the <em>human front & center</em> in every decision.
            </h4>

        </div>

        <h4><em>... But what does that mean in practice?</em></h4>
        <blockquote>
            It means I design with clarity, accessibility, and emotional comfort in mind — especially for
            people who feel underserved or overwhelmed by technology.

    <!-- HOW I THINK -->
    <section id="how-i-think">
        <h2>How I Think 💡</h2>

        <h3>Simplifying complexity</h3>
        <div class="think-row">
            <img src="assets/logo_instructor.png" class="think-img"
                 alt="Icon of an instructor breaking down complex problems" />
            <div class="think-text">
                Teaching programming to teenagers taught me how to break down abstract ideas into clear,
                approachable steps. That same ability now helps me structure interfaces, reduce cognitive load,
                and guide users through tasks with ease and confidence.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Designing with empathy</h3>
        <div class="think-row">
            <img src="assets/logo_caregiver.png" class="think-img"
                 alt="Icon representing empathy and caregiving experience" />
            <div class="think-text">
                Working with people across different ages and cognitive/physical needs strengthened my observation
                skills and adaptability. Small cues like hesitation, confusion, or discomfort help me identify
                friction and design for clarity, comfort, and emotional ease.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Human-first, tech-aware</h3>
        <div class="think-row">
            <img src="assets/logo_cs.png" class="think-img"
                 alt="Icon illustrating the connection between people, features, and technology into a puzzle " />
            <div class="think-text">
                My computer science background helps me understand constraints and feasibility, but my decisions
                always start with people. This balance allows me to collaborate smoothly with developers and project
                managers while continuously advocating for real user needs.

    <!-- IMPROVING -->
    <section id="improving">
        <h2>What I’m Improving 🧱</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strengthening visual design foundations and layout clarity</li>
            <li>More intentional, faster prototyping in Figma</li>
            <li>Usability testing → synthesis → clearer design decisions</li>
            <li>Learning from real products to understand interaction patterns</li>

    <!-- TOOLS -->
    <section id="tools">
        <h2>Tools 🛠</h2>
        <p>
            I always begin with <strong>Pen & Paper</strong>. There’s something about sketching freely (without grids,
            components, or tools) that helps me listen to the idea before shaping it. Once the core feels clear on paper,
            I move to <strong>Figma</strong> to give it structure, <strong>Miro</strong> to expand it with others, then
            shift to <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> whenever technical awareness and collaboration
            helps guide clearer, more feasible design decisions.
