##Dear visitor, welcome to my personal webpage!
If you landed here, you probably wish to know a bit about me and my work. If it was an accidental click however, no hard feelings… You are still welcome to skim through the page, get to know a bit about me, and connect to my social networks – for feedback, professional contact or just plain good old friendship.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pradoprojects/pradoprojects.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pradoprojects/pradoprojects.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
