### Bio
#### A matter of Curiosity, Accessibility and Avocados 


<p style="font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;"> ü¶ù + üë®‚Äçü¶Ω + ü•ë </p>

Long story short, I was a young STEAM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) passionate boy, born and raised in the 80/90‚Äôs in a rural region of Brazil that grew into a 36 year old User Experience (UX) enthusiast, tech curious and nature lover. So yes, the child alive inside me keeps bugging me to constantly analyze my innumerous daily experiences going from the new gadgets and packages in the market shelf, to the accessibility issues in the closest pharmacy store -- that weirdly demands people having a car to get tested for Covid-19! It is also this inner energy that motivates me to disassemble and repair my (and my friends') broken device ‚Äì just for the sake of curiosity and self-compensation if I succeed in bringing it back to life. Oh, and last but not least, there is a lot of this youth solicitude behind the many hours I spent along my life planting avocado seeds -- just because they look chock-full of life to be trashed away after giving me a delicious morning milkshake.
