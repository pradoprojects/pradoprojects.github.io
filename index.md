# Hi, I’m Marllos 👋 
### Early-career UX & Product Designer | Focused on clarity and thoughtful problem-solving.

> #### I’m building a career shaped by *continuous learning*, *multicultural experiences*, and bringing the *human front & center* to each decision.  
<div class="card" align="center">
  <img src="assets/uxlogo_r.png" width="100%" />
</div>

#### *... But what does it mean?*
> It means I care about crafting UI/UX that feels intuitive, calm, and accessible — especially for people who don’t consider themselves “techy.”

## How I Think 💡

### Simplifying complexity
<div class="card" align="center">
  <img src="assets/logo_instructor.png" width="50%" />
  <div> Teaching basic programming to teenagers showed me how to break down abstract concepts into clear, approachable steps — a skill that directly shapes how I build interfaces and structure information.</div>
</div>

### Designing with empathy
<div class="card" align="center">
  <img src="assets/logo_caregiver.png" width="50%" />
  <div> Working with people of different ages and cognitive/physical needs strengthened my observation skills, patience, and adaptability. These experiences help me identify friction and design for comfort, not just functionality.</div>
</div>

### Human-first, tech-aware  
My computer science background helps me understand constraints and feasibility,  
but my design decisions always begin with people, not features.
