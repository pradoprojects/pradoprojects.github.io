#### A matter of curiosity, accessibility and avocados. 


<p style="padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;"> 🦝 + 👨‍🦽 + 🥑 </p>

Long story short, I was a young STEAM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) passionate boy, born and raised in the 80/90’s in a rural region of Brazil that grew up into a 36 year old User Experience (UX) enthusiast, tech curious and nature lover. So yes, the child alive inside me keeps bugging me to constantly analyze my innumerous daily experiences going from the new gadgets and packages in the market shelf, to the accessibility issues in the closest pharmacy store -- that weirdly demands people having a car to get tested for Covid-19! It is also this inner energy that motivates me to disassemble and reassemble my (and my friends') broken devices – just for the sake of curiosity and self-compensation if I succeed in bringing it back to life. Oh, and last but not least, there is a lot of this youth solicitude behind the many hours I spent along my life planting avocado seeds -- only because they look too chock-full of life to be trashed away after preparing a delicious matinal avo-shake!

## My Route to UX
#### ... a testing fate or a test of fate ...

<p style="padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">  🐜 || 🎲 </p>

My professional story with UX remounts the beginning of the 90’s when I got my first job as a multimedia developer for high-school classes. It was a fantastic digital creativity experience that helped me feel in love with many activities that were later coined under the User Experience label. Time flew by at work in those times and the salary helped me pay my bills! It also gave me confidence to course the Computer Science program two years later. During the CS program, I developed a lot of mathematical/programming skills. However, because the bachelor program lacked a Human Computer Interaction professor in that time, I couldn’t pursue my former passion and ended up doing my final project in software testing – an area that arouse my interest both because of the supervision of my excellent advisor (Auri Vincenzi) and the load of problem-solving skills that software testing demanded and motivated me to pursue. This work opened the doors to my Master degree, where I could sharpen my scientific mindset and prepare to my PhD. During my PhD, I could observe that many of the testing tools were cumbersome to use and related in the literature to low effectiveness and efficacy of testing in practice. This instigated my curiosity to research the problem, in special the lack of cognitive support provided by unit testing tools. Summarizing, my years as a testing researcher slowly brought me back to the User Experience field -- and I am super thankful for this fate!

## Becoming a UX designer
#### Cuisine with a grain of Class.

<p style="padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">  👨‍🍳 && 👨‍🏫 </p>

The same way STEAM activities were a thing way before someone coined a name, I consider that User Experience took the same evolutionary route. Both are an amalgam of practical and subjective multidisciplinary concepts that we finally have a name to designate.

From my perspective and experience, User Experience shares a lot of commonalities with gastronomy and teaching: It doesn’t matter the amount of ingredients or theoretical knowledge you have at your disposal. If you can’t put things nicely together for YOUR audience you’ll fail to captivate them, convey your message and create a remarkable memory. I am not saying you must award the equivalent to a Michelin or Global Teacher Prize before adventuring yourself into the UX field. But your UX design output must at least provoke similar feelings to that memorable dish that you tasted a decade ago during a trip, in a remote underrated restaurant – or the classes of that teacher in your old school who immersed you and your classmates in a journey through space and time. In this sense, I’d risk to say that UX is part art, part science, but invariable driven by PURPOSE in every point of decision – put in or taken out.  

As precisely coined by Louis Sullivan: “form follows function”. This max should guide all the points of decisions in a project that takes UX into consideration. This means that the focus for modeling the solution should not be in the product or service alone, but in the story that the person will live when in contact with the designed experience. It can’t come before or after, but along and intertwined in the project. This entails two major aspects: developing UX skills demands sharpening empathy and critical sense in ourselves. 

#### 👂 Empathy  

Empathy is directly connected to the artistic portion of UX. Without empathy you can’t wear somebody’s shoes and truly access their necessities, emotions, aims and claims. Put simply for Marvel fans, lack of empathy in UX design is your passport into Wandavision World. For non-marvel fans, lack of empathy is your passport for Wishful Thinking… You will fail in providing an effective experience because you will be mirroring your inner feelings in the design. It can sound true, vibrant and energetic to you. But it is as ineffective to others as you trying to recognize yourself in a mirror that reflects somebody else’s image.  This is easier said than done, especially in a world that discourages empathy in many areas. The good news is that you can always revive and channel empathy towards design if caring about people is something that triggers your self-reward mechanism. It surely does on me.

#### 🔬 Critical Sense

I tend to see the critical sense as the main scientific skill demanded in UX design. By sharpening critical sense, you are mastering your ability to take different perspectives in the analyses of the problem. That means you must be relentlessly open to evaluate and reevaluate the problem and the methods employed. You shall visit past success and failures in similar and opposite projects. You must be willing to break apart and recombine the original problem, flip it upside-down as many time as possible, until the “form follows function” key is activated. True critical sense demands high-doses of persistence and resilience to failure. Of course the “fail fast, learn fast” approach is always welcome when it fits the problem. But as history teaches us, Thomas Edison made around 1K unsuccessful attempts at inventing the light bulb. In such cases, recalibrating the speed of “fast” can be an exercise of humbleness and acknowledging boundaries. Nonetheless, no one can deny the impact that electrical light had to modern life experience.

## My 1st (amatour) UX design
#### A tale of two unattended kids and a tired mom.

<p style="padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;"> 🏃‍♀️ 👩‍⚕️ 🏃‍</p>


I think my first act trying to design user experience happened in the form of a game that me and my young sister created to surprise our mom when we were kids. My mother was a nurse and when she started to work in the emergency of the hospital, we felt that she arrived too exhausted at home. Because we missed spending time with her, but also knew she was too tired to spend the rest of the night with us instead of falling sleep, one day I came up with this idea to promote a kind of surprizing spa at home for her. As we were a poor family and hadn't had any contact with a SPA before, we simply called it the “LM moment” just as our initials (Lorena and Marllos). It consisted of cleaning the house to mint condition during the day, swap the position of some furnitures and preparing a set of activities to promote her relaxation since the moment she stepped inside home: like in a concierge service, we used to welcome her by hand from the car door, blindfolded and carried her by hand inside home, under a relaxing music. We lighted incenses along the way so she could start the relaxing process while keeping her curiosity about what was going to happen next. Than we invited her to go take a shower, handing her a clean and ironed towels, a smelling soap, and a comfortable nightdress, while we finished preparing her dinner. After finishing the shower, we asked her to go rest in the sofa, with the lights turned off and just some lit candles in the room. My sister did her a massage in her feet while I finished the dinner and put the table. Me and my sister agreed no conversations or questioning were allowed at that moment, even if she insisted. Just smiles and the muted enjoyment of the moment. As you can imagine, she was intrigued but wondered by the surprise, created by a 13 and 10 years old kids. We, as well, were amazed by our ability to achieve so much in a day. We transformed a boring routine of cleaning the house, doing the dishes, and cooking into something with purpose. Even tired, we knew we had promoted a blissful moment for her and for us. All of our effort paid off. Of course, the LM moment was not something that we had energy to do daily, because we were kids and it required us to be constantly innovating, so we could keep the surprising element. But it was something  we did once in a while, like in her birthday, or when she reported a tough day in the phone. 

#### ❣ A takeaway message

One important thing that I notice nowadays, looking back to this “LM moment” game, was that as in a user-centered design, all of our decisions had my mothers' desires and context in mind: what food does she like? Is it too heavy for the sleep? what singer she enjoys? Are the songs and volume calm enough for the moment? What soap and incense are we going to use to make her comfortable? Is the bath towel fluffy? Are the furnitures in a welcoming position – or will this swap just make her angry? Are the dogs already fed so that their barking doesn’t disrupt her relaxing moment? Details, details, details… all decisions having her in mind and each of them driven by a purpose. I know, I know… this may sound a silly idea of UX and not applied to tech. But who says UX is something exclusive to tech? Even intuitively, we had to make up all the five design thinking stages in our preparation: Empathizing, Defining, Ideating, Prototyping and Testing. For two young unsupervised kids in the 90s, it was a big accomplishment. And without any doubt a huge mom experience. All motivated by pure empathy!
