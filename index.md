# Hi, I’m Marllos  
### Early-career UX & Product Designer  
Focused on clarity, accessibility, and thoughtful problem-solving.

I’m building a design career shaped by hands-on learning, multicultural experiences, teaching, and caregiving.  
I’m drawn to roles with mentorship, collaboration, and real product impact — environments where curiosity and intention matter.

I care about creating interfaces that feel intuitive, calm, and accessible, especially for people who don’t consider themselves “techy.”

## How I Think

### Simplifying complexity  
Teaching programming to teenagers showed me how to break down abstract concepts into clear, approachable steps — a skill that directly shapes how I build interfaces and structure information.

### Designing with empathy  
Working with people of different ages and cognitive/physical needs strengthened my observation skills, patience, and adaptability.  
These experiences help me identify friction and design for comfort, not just functionality.

### Human-first, tech-aware  
My computer science background helps me understand constraints and feasibility,  
but my design decisions always begin with people, not features.
